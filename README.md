### **Description: A* Algorithm for Drone Navigation**

The A* algorithm (A-star) is a popular pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm widely used in robotics, games, and navigation systems. It combines features of both Dijkstra's Algorithm (which finds the shortest path) and Greedy Best-First Search (which focuses on moving towards the goal). 

In the context of drone navigation, the A* algorithm is used to guide a drone from a start location to a goal destination while avoiding obstacles and minimizing the total travel distance.

The A* algorithm works as follows:
1. It maintains two lists:
   - **Open list**: Contains nodes to be evaluated.
   - **Closed list**: Contains nodes that have already been evaluated.
   
2. Each node has three cost values:
   - **g(x)**: The actual cost from the start node to the current node.
   - **h(x)**: A heuristic estimate of the cost from the current node to the goal node (e.g., the straight-line distance).
   - **f(x)**: The total cost function, calculated as `f(x) = g(x) + h(x)`.

3. The algorithm iteratively selects the node with the lowest `f(x)` value, expands it, and adds its neighbors to the open list.

4. The process repeats until the goal node is reached, producing the shortest possible path.

This implementation of the A* algorithm for drones includes features such as:
- Dynamic grid representation of the environment.
- Configurable start, goal, and obstacle locations.
- Real-time visualization of the pathfinding process.
- Adjustable movement cost, which can factor in different terrains or flight conditions.

# A* Algorithm for Drone Navigation

## Overview

This project implements the A* (A-star) algorithm for a drone navigation system. The goal is to compute the optimal path for the drone to travel from a start position to a goal while avoiding obstacles in the environment. The A* algorithm uses a combination of distance and heuristic calculations to find the shortest path efficiently.

The project is designed to simulate a dynamic grid environment, where the drone can navigate through various cells, avoiding walls or obstacles, with adjustable parameters like start and goal positions.

## Features

- **Dynamic Grid**: Visualizes the grid-based environment with user-configurable start, goal, and obstacle points.
- **Real-time Visualization**: Displays the step-by-step process of pathfinding using A*.
- **Heuristic Function**: Utilizes the Manhattan distance for grid-based movement, with options to modify for other heuristics.
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Efficient path calculation that avoids collisions with obstacles or walls.
- **Drone Simulation**: Can simulate the drone's path based on calculated trajectories.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `heapq`, `pygame` (for visualization)

You can install the necessary libraries using:
```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy pygame
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/drone-astar-navigation.git
    ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd drone-astar-navigation
    ```

3. Run the main script to simulate the drone navigation:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

### Configuration

You can customize the grid size, start point, goal point, and obstacle positions by editing the `config.json` file:
```json
{
  "grid_size": [20, 20],
  "start": [0, 0],
  "goal": [19, 19],
  "obstacles": [
    [5, 5], [6, 5], [7, 5], [8, 5]
  ]
}
```

### Usage

- Once the program starts, you will see a grid representing the drone's environment.
- The start point is marked in green, the goal in red, and obstacles in black.
- The drone will calculate the shortest path using the A* algorithm and move step by step towards the goal.
- If the path is blocked, the algorithm will reroute to find another optimal path.

## Example

Here's an example scenario with a 10x10 grid, a start point at (0, 0), a goal at (9, 9), and some obstacles in between:

The A* algorithm will find the shortest path around the obstacles, as shown in the simulation.

## Future Improvements

- 3D grid navigation for more complex environments.
- Dynamic obstacles and real-time recalculation.
- Integration with drone flight hardware for real-world testing.
